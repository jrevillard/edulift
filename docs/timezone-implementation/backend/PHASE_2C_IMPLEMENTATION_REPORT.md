# Phase 2C Implementation Report: Backend Schedule Filtering by Week

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Dependencies:** Phase 2B (ISO Week Utils) - COMPLETED ✅

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented timezone-aware schedule filtering in the backend repository layer. The implementation ensures that weekly schedule queries use user timezone boundaries instead of UTC, providing consistent week filtering aligned with users' local calendars.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/workspace/backend/src/repositories/ScheduleSlotRepository.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `getWeekBoundaries` and `getDateFromISOWeek` from isoWeekUtils
- Added new method: `getScheduleByWeek(groupId, year, week, timezone)`
- Added new method: `getScheduleByWeekFromDate(groupId, datetime, timezone)`
- Deprecated `getWeeklyScheduleByDateRange` (maintains backward compatibility)

**New Methods:**

#### `getScheduleByWeek(groupId, year, week, timezone)`
```typescript
/**
 * Get schedule for a specific ISO week in the user's timezone
 *
 * Calculates week boundaries (Monday 00:00 to Sunday 23:59:59.999) in the user's
 * timezone and converts to UTC for database queries.
 *
 * @param groupId - The group ID to filter schedules
 * @param year - ISO week year
 * @param week - ISO week number (1-53)
 * @param timezone - IANA timezone string (e.g., "Europe/Paris", "Asia/Tokyo")
 * @returns Schedule slots within the week boundaries
 */
```

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// Get Week 1 of 2024 in Asia/Tokyo timezone
// Week starts: Monday 2024-01-01 00:00 JST (2023-12-31 15:00 UTC)
// Week ends: Sunday 2024-01-07 23:59:59.999 JST (2024-01-07 14:59:59.999 UTC)
const schedules = await repository.getScheduleByWeek('group-1', 2024, 1, 'Asia/Tokyo');
```

#### `getScheduleByWeekFromDate(groupId, datetime, timezone)`
```typescript
/**
 * Get weekly schedule by date range with timezone awareness
 *
 * Takes a reference datetime and calculates the week boundaries in the user's timezone.
 * More convenient than getScheduleByWeek when you have a datetime rather than week number.
 *
 * @param groupId - The group ID to filter schedules
 * @param datetime - Reference datetime (will find the week containing this datetime)
 * @param timezone - IANA timezone string
 * @returns Schedule slots within the week boundaries
 */
```

**Example Usage:**
```typescript
// Get the week containing Jan 3, 2024 in America/Los_Angeles
const schedules = await repository.getScheduleByWeekFromDate(
  'group-1',
  new Date('2024-01-03T10:00:00Z'),
  'America/Los_Angeles'
);
```

### 2. `/workspace/backend/src/repositories/__tests__/ScheduleSlotRepository.test.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `isoWeekUtils`
- Added comprehensive test suite: "Timezone-Aware Week Filtering (Phase 2C)"
- Total new tests: **12 tests**

**Test Coverage:**

1. ✅ Filter schedules by week in user timezone (Asia/Tokyo)
2. ✅ Exclude schedules outside week boundaries
3. ✅ Handle week spanning two UTC days at start (America/Los_Angeles)
4. ✅ Handle week spanning two UTC days at end (Europe/Paris)
5. ✅ Handle DST transition week correctly (America/New_York)
6. ✅ Verify isoWeekUtils.getDateFromISOWeek called with correct parameters
7. ✅ Filter schedules by week from reference datetime
8. ✅ Verify isoWeekUtils.getWeekBoundaries called with correct parameters
9. ✅ Accept ISO string as datetime parameter
10. ✅ Handle timezone transitions correctly when finding week from date
11. ✅ Deprecated method (getWeeklyScheduleByDateRange) still works
12. ✅ New methods include same relations as deprecated method

### 3. `/workspace/backend/src/scripts/verify-phase2c.ts` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Demonstration and verification script showing timezone-aware week filtering in action

**Features:**
- Shows week boundary calculations for multiple timezones
- Demonstrates schedule inclusion/exclusion examples
- Verifies correct UTC conversion from user timezone boundaries

## Verification Examples

### Test Case 1: Asia/Tokyo (UTC+9)

**Week 1, 2024 Boundaries:**
- User TZ Start: Monday 2024-01-01 00:00 JST
- UTC Start: **2023-12-31T15:00:00.000Z** ✅
- User TZ End: Sunday 2024-01-07 23:59:59.999 JST
- UTC End: **2024-01-07T14:59:59.999Z** ✅

**Schedule Filtering Examples:**

| UTC Datetime | Local Time (JST) | Included? | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| 2023-12-31T14:59:00Z | Sun 2023-12-31 23:59 | ❌ EXCLUDE | Before week (Sunday of prev week) |
| 2023-12-31T15:00:00Z | Mon 2024-01-01 00:00 | ✅ INCLUDE | At week start boundary |
| 2024-01-01T05:00:00Z | Mon 2024-01-01 14:00 | ✅ INCLUDE | Within week (Monday afternoon) |
| 2024-01-07T10:00:00Z | Sun 2024-01-07 19:00 | ✅ INCLUDE | Within week (Sunday evening) |
| 2024-01-07T14:59:59.999Z | Sun 2024-01-07 23:59:59.999 | ✅ INCLUDE | At week end boundary |
| 2024-01-07T15:00:00Z | Mon 2024-01-08 00:00 | ❌ EXCLUDE | After week (Monday of next week) |

### Test Case 2: America/Los_Angeles (UTC-8)

**Week 1, 2024 Boundaries:**
- User TZ Start: Monday 2024-01-01 00:00 PST
- UTC Start: **2024-01-01T08:00:00.000Z** ✅
- User TZ End: Sunday 2024-01-07 23:59:59.999 PST
- UTC End: **2024-01-08T07:59:59.999Z** ✅

**Note:** Week end spans into next UTC day due to negative offset.

### Test Case 3: Europe/Paris (UTC+1)

**Week 1, 2024 Boundaries:**
- User TZ Start: Monday 2024-01-01 00:00 CET
- UTC Start: **2023-12-31T23:00:00.000Z** ✅
- User TZ End: Sunday 2024-01-07 23:59:59.999 CET
- UTC End: **2024-01-07T22:59:59.999Z** ✅

**Note:** Week start is on previous UTC day due to positive offset.

## DST Handling

The implementation correctly handles Daylight Saving Time transitions:

- Uses Luxon's timezone-aware date manipulation
- Week boundaries automatically adjust for DST changes
- Tested with America/New_York DST transition (March 10, 2024)
- Week duration verified to be 7 days regardless of DST

---

## Database Query Pattern

All new methods follow the same pattern:

1. **Calculate week boundaries in user timezone** using `getWeekBoundaries()`
2. **Convert boundaries to UTC** (handled by isoWeekUtils)
3. **Query database with UTC boundaries** using `gte` and `lte`
4. **Database stores UTC**, but filtering respects user's local week

**Example Query:**
```typescript
// User requests Week 1, 2024 in Asia/Tokyo
const { weekStart, weekEnd } = getWeekBoundaries(
  getDateFromISOWeek(2024, 1, 'Asia/Tokyo'),
  'Asia/Tokyo'
);

// Database query with UTC boundaries
prisma.scheduleSlot.findMany({
  where: {
    groupId: 'group-1',
    datetime: {
      gte: weekStart,   // 2023-12-31T15:00:00.000Z
      lte: weekEnd      // 2024-01-07T14:59:59.999Z
    }
  }
});
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Maintained:** The deprecated `getWeeklyScheduleByDateRange` method continues to work for existing code.

⚠️ **Migration Path:** New code should use:
- `getScheduleByWeek()` when you have year/week numbers
- `getScheduleByWeekFromDate()` when you have a reference datetime

---

## Integration Points

These repository methods can now be used by:

1. **Controllers/Routes** - API endpoints for weekly schedule retrieval
2. **Services** - Business logic requiring timezone-aware week filtering
3. **Background Jobs** - Scheduled tasks processing weekly data
4. **Reports** - Weekly summary generation in user timezone

---

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ **No additional database queries** - Uses existing indexes
- ✅ **Efficient boundary calculation** - Single call to isoWeekUtils
- ✅ **Optimized includes** - Same eager loading as deprecated method
- ✅ **Proper ordering** - Results sorted by datetime ascending

---

## Key Benefits

1. ✅ **User-Centric Filtering** - Week boundaries match user's calendar
2. ✅ **Timezone Accuracy** - Handles all IANA timezones correctly
3. ✅ **DST Safe** - Automatic DST transition handling
4. ✅ **Edge Case Handling** - Correct behavior at year boundaries
5. ✅ **Well Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage (12 new tests)
6. ✅ **Documented** - Clear API docs and examples
7. ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing code continues to work

---

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

- Phase 2D: Update API endpoints to accept timezone parameter
- Phase 2E: Frontend integration with timezone-aware queries
- Phase 2F: Mobile app integration with timezone-aware queries

## Files Summary

| File | Type | Lines Added | Tests Added |

## Conclusion

Phase 2C has been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Full timezone awareness for schedule filtering
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
