- ✅ Handles mobile deep link patterns

### Performance Testing (✅ VERIFIED)

**Load Testing**
- ✅ 100 concurrent validations complete within 1 second
- ✅ Large family objects (100+ members) processed efficiently
- ✅ 1000+ metadata fields parsed within 100ms
- ✅ Memory usage remains stable during concurrent operations

## EDGE CASES COVERAGE

### Null Field Scenarios (✅ COMPLETE)
